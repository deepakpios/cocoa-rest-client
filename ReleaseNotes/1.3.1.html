New in 1.3.1:

* Bugfix: correctly decode content served in ISO-8859-1 encoding (such as google.com)

New in 1.3.0:

* Adding import and export requests. On exports, you will be prompted to select which requests you would like to export. On imports, you will also be prompted to select which requests from the imported file you would like to add to your drawer of requests. This feature can be accessed through the file menu or request can be imported by dragging them into the drawer.

* Adding sent request headers to the response area.

* Adding ability to overwrite existing requests in the saved requests drawer by choosing File > Overwrite Request or by pressing Control-Command-S.

* Adding indefinite progress indicator that runs while requests are in progress.
